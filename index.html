The experience at these institutions prepared him to handle the nuances of growing organisations and an understanding of finance that enabled him to lead JBCN Education. His experience as a student of the IBDP programme enabled him to take a two pronged approach: as a student and as an educator. Today, under his dynamic leadership, JBCN has launched its new initiative, “Nation of Learning Excellence”, an endeavour to provide top-quality professional development opportunities from across the world and India to educators across the spectrum. </p>
